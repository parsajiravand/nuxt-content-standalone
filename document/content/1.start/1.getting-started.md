## Create a new project

1. Install Nuxt Content Stand theme in your project:

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install nuxt-content-stand
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add nuxt-content-stand
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install nuxt-content-stand
```

::

2. Extend the `nuxt.config.js` file with the theme in the `extends` array (or `extends` property if you use TypeScript):

::code-group

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: "nuxt-content-stand",
});
```

::

::alert{type="success"}
âœ¨ Well done! You can create your first Markdown file in the `content` folder.
