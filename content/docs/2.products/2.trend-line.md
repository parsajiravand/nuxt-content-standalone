# Trend Line

![Trend Line Product](/img/trend-line/overview.png)

Trend lines are powerful tools that aid in the identification and confirmation of trends in financial markets. These lines connect a minimum of two price points on a chart and are typically projected forward to identify areas of sloped support and resistance. A trend line with a positive slope that supports price action indicates an increase in net-demand. This means that as long as the price action remains above this line, a bullish trend persists. Conversely, a trend line with a negative slope that resists price action signifies an increase in net-supply. As long as the price action remains below this line, a bearish trend remains intact.


In technical analysis, a sloped trend line is often tested by the price multiple times until it eventually breaks, which may indicate a trend reversal. The strength of a trend line increases as it connects more price points. However, various strategies may have different rules regarding the distance between connected price points and whether to connect wicks or candle bodies. Despite these differences, it's important to recognize that all trend lines will eventually break.


Traders use trend lines to identify potential price movements and make more informed decisions about buying and selling securities. By analyzing how a trend line interacts with price action over time, traders can gain insights into the strength and direction of the trend. When a trend line breaks, it's a signal that the previous trend may be over and a new trend is emerging. This can be an opportunity to take profits or initiate new trades, depending on the trader's strategy and risk tolerance.


Our new indicator introduces pivot point-based trend lines that highlight breakouts, providing traders with valuable insights into market trends. With this tool, users can customize the steepness of the trend lines and choose their preferred method for calculating the slope.


By providing greater flexibility and control over trend line analysis, our indicator can help traders make more informed decisions about buying and selling securities. With customizable settings and highlighted breakouts, this tool can provide traders with a comprehensive view of market trends and potential opportunities for profit.


## Setting

![Trend Line Setting](/img/trend-line/setting.png)

Our indicator comes with several customizable settings that allow traders to fine-tune their analysis to fit their trading strategy. These settings include:
- **_Length_**: This setting determines the period for calculating pivot points. By adjusting the length, traders can choose how many previous periods to include in their analysis. • Slope: This setting controls the steepness of the trend lines. Values greater than 1 produce steeper trend lines, while a value of 0 returns level lines.
- **_Slope_**: This setting controls the steepness of the trend lines. Values greater than 1 produce steeper trend lines, while a value of 0 returns level lines.
- **_Slope Calculation Method_**: This setting determines how the slope is calculated. By choosing from different calculation methods, traders can find the one that best fits their analysis. • Show Only Confirmed Breakouts: When enabled, this setting shows only confirmed breakouts, helping traders filter out false signals and make more informed trading decisions. With these customizable settings, our indicator provides traders with a powerful tool for analyzing market trends and identifying potential trading opportunities.


## Usage
Our indicator is designed to be compatible with any valid trend line methodology, providing traders with a powerful tool for identifying breakouts and inferring future price movements.

Break labels highlight breakouts, indicating potential shifts in market trends. By default, the indicator shows all breakouts, but traders can toggle on "Show Only Confirmed Breakouts" to filter out false signals and focus on the most significant ones. Note that this setting does not affect breakouts with dashed trendlines, which are displayed without delay.


The calculation method used for slope can have a significant impact on the behavior of trendlines. By default, our indicator uses an average true range calculation, which produces consistent slopes across different trendlines. However, other calculation methods may result in trendlines with significantly different slopes.
