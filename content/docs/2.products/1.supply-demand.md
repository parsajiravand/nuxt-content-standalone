:::

## Features 
Here we describe what we offer in Supply Demand, and how it works. If you want a feature, feel free to contact us.

## Multi Time Frame

![Supply and Demand Multi Time Frame](/img/supply-demand/multi-time-frame.png)

As basic philosophy, fractal-based behavior of financial markets in supply and demand trading systems, if you activate this feature, our product analyzes and shows zones in three-time frames.
- Long Term is the highest time frame used to find a first zone.
- Mid Term is a middle time frame to optimize zone.
- Short Term is a short time frame to enter trade.
Every time frame has its own style and color you can change them in the settings. 

## Draw Mode
Here we introduce a feature that is called draw mode. When you activate this mode, you can create zones manually. Just click on rectangle shape and draw, simplest way to new zone.

## Auto Indicator

![Supply and Demand Auto Indicator](/img/supply-demand/auto-indicator-aggressive.png)

It automatically analyzes and creates trading zones to prepare the chart for you. We have three modes here.
- regular (normal style of supply and demand algorithm, daily trading style)
- Aggressive (sensitive style of supply and demand algorithm, scalp/intraday trading style)
- Confidence (strong supply and demand algorithm style, trend/swing trading style)

### Regular Example

### Aggressive Example

### Confidence Example

## Trading
Here we offer a **Supply Demand** that can take trade. We have three modes for this feature.
### 1. Disabled
In this state, Supply Demand does not do anything related to trade. It just works as a simple indicator.
### 2. Manual
This state stands for semi-automatic trading, which means inside of each zone (which draw manually or created by algorithm) you have two buttons. The first one is to activate trade mode of that zone (not relates to other zones), and the other button for close all positions of that trade of zone.
You can select a zone to get ready for trade as *Supply/Demand*, *Supply*, *Demand*, and *Inactive*.

|  Mode	        | Trade |
|      :-:	    |  :-:	|
| Supply/Demand | Sell and Buy |
| Supply  	    | Sell  	   |
| Demand  	    | Buy  	       |
| Inactive      | No Trade     |   

### 3. Auto Trade
This state works as full functionality for trade. It opens, manages, and exits trades automatically.

## Reverse Positioning

![Supply and Demand Reverse Positioning](/img/supply-demand/reverse-positioning.png)

Supply and demand trading are always looking for trading zones, sometimes zones have been broken and turncoat to opposite direction, in other words, supply trading zone turncoat to demand trading zone. For example, after a few down movements from one supply zone, its price breaks the opposite edge of zone and goes up. For some cases like this we offer a feature called **Reverse Positioning**. While you activate this feature, when zone break and change price direction to opposite side, **Supply Demand** close previous trade and open opposite direction trade. You can change maximum reverse trades in the settings.

## Trail Entry

![Supply and Demand Trail Entry](/img/supply-demand/trail-entry.png)

Most of us know trail stops, a well-known feature in trading systems. Here we introduce trail entry, that trail entry price to catch lower price to buy or higher price to sell. You can update settings as enable/disable, trail entry step as move entry price every x step and stop trail entry for condition price come back from highest/lowest price seen. 

## Virtual TP/SL

![Supply and Demand Vrtual TP/SL](/img/supply-demand/virtual-price.png)

All financial markets have a spread as difference between buyers and seller's rate. We offer a feature called Virtual TP/SL that removes all hard TPs and SLs, then handles all positions functionality by seller's rate to get work smoothly other features as reverse positioning. 

## Max Zone Trade

![Supply and Demand Max Zone Trade](/img/supply-demand/max-zone-trades.png)

Most trades have their own trading style, but the general concept of supply and demand are the same in basic. Every zone has its own validity, which is calculated via a multi time frame and price behavior with zone. So, we added a feature to allow you to limit the maximum trades to one zone. For example, if these feature settings are set to two, that means after zone created, software takes two cycles of trades. So, if price comes back for third time to zone, software does not take any action to trade.

## Rounded Numbers

![Supply and Demand Rounded Numbers](/img/supply-demand/rounded-number-after.png)

Psychology is an important part of trading and here rounded numbers enter the game. Most pivot points are in rounded numbers that have a mental effect on trader's decisions to enter/exit trade.
In Supply Demand product you can filter how detect rounded numbers (in decimals) and filter zones as how far from rounded numbers.

### Before Rounded Numbers Filter

![Supply and Demand Before Rounded Numbers Filter](/img/supply-demand/rounded-number-before.png)

### After Rounded Numbers Filter

![Supply and Demand After Rounded Numbers Filter](/img/supply-demand/rounded-number-after.png)

## Nearest Zone

![Supply and Demand After Nearest Zone](/img/supply-demand/nearest-zone-after.png)

Here we are introducing a filter that you can use for distance of zones together, in other words when new zone created, we are looking for nearest zone and if they are so close then we ignore new zone. Most common in retracement or divergence cases this situation will happen.
You can change settings as how far in points format to nearest zone to execute your ideal condition.

:::warning ONLY Auto Indicator
This zone filter will affect zones created by the indicator algorithm. It does not take any action if you draw zones manually nearer than filter.

## Zone Size Filters

![Supply and Demand After Zone Size Filter](/img/supply-demand/zone-size-after.png)

Auto zone algorithm create zones in separate ways and properties. One of the most important properties is size. This is a matter in trading, especially as day trading. So, we introduced a feature that you can filter zone size, if the maximum or minimum size from settings does not meet the condition of new zone, software will ignore new zone.

:::warning ONLY Auto Indicator
This zone filter will affect zones created by the indicator algorithm. It does not take any action if you draw zones manually larger or smaller than zone size settings.

## Position Management

![Supply and Demand Position Management](/img/supply-demand/position-management-3positioning.png)

As rich feature trading system, here we introduce position management, that manage of your positions as partial close. In other words, when a system enters trade, opens partial positions with different stop losses and target profits, then modify stop losses like elevator movement to next floor of positions.
For example, we have a famous default position management as 3X model. In this model, we enter one trade with three separated positions, all of entries are same, all stop losses are same, targets of them divided to three by final target. So, when trade goes into profit and hits the first target price, it closes first position, and moves second and third positions stop losses to first position entry. Then when positions go into profit more and achieve second target price, it closes second position and moves third position stop loss to first position target price. 
Also, we have been making an option to define your custom position management. You can define by points or percentage calculation, e.g. When position achieve into 50% profit of the final target, it will close 60% of position. 

### Position Management with 3 Positioning

## Risk Free

![Supply and Demand Risk Free](/img/supply-demand/risk-free.png)

Here we are introducing risk free feature. You can activate risk free features, in points or percentage mode of position. Also, we have a costless option to cover trading costs. In the table below you can see the formula of different options.

:::info Risk Free Options in Panel
Below marked characters as bold characters, will show on panel, e.g. RF: A, it means our software will risk free with *All* options as below table.
:::

|  Option	    | Covered Cost |
|      :-:	    |     :-:      |
| **C**ommission    | Commission   |
| **S**pread        | Spread  	   |
| S**W**ap  	    | Swap  	   |
| **A**ll           | Commission + Spread + Swap |   
| **N**one          | Nothing      |

## Trail Stop

![Supply and Demand Trail Stop](/img/supply-demand/trail-stop.png)

Trail stop is featured to move stop loss of positions, It works in two modes, points, or percentage calculation mode. In this feature, when position achieve start trail stop loss value from settings, we must trail stop loss. Also, we have trail stop loss step that means after last highest price, how much price should go to more profit to continue trailing again stop loss.
For example if you set trail stop loss to 100 and trail stop loss mode in points, so your stop loss start trailing after your position is in 100 points profit, and then waiting for your trail stop loss step, if you set it to 50 and trail stop loss step mode set to point it means when your position enter 150 points, your stop loss will be update. In this case when the price reverses back 50 points from the highest price seen in market for position, stop loss will hit and exit from position.

## Money Management

![Supply and Demand Money Management](/img/supply-demand/money-management.png)

Every trading system has its own money management rules. Here we have been defined and tested three default money management programs. Also, as usual you can define your custom money management plan.

## Risk Management

![Supply and Demand Risk Management](/img/supply-demand/risk-management.png)

Risk is the main part of financial markets. In **Supply Demand** we have been introducing a default risk management plan as how bank`s trader's work. In general, you can disable risk management programs or activate them. You can use 3X4 default program or define your custom risk management program in settings.

### 3X4 Program
The default Risk to Reward ratio is 1:3 so we risk 2.5% for 7.5% reward on every trading cycle. On every four target prices hit consecutively, we doubled the lot size. On every stop loss hit we make half our lot size. Below we get an example to clarify risk management program functionality.

:::tip NEVER LOSE AGAIN
3X4 Risk Management program does not allow trading system to never come back to previous balance. It's AMAZING!

## Anti-Martingale (Reverse Martingale)

![Supply and Demand Anti-Martingale](/img/supply-demand/anti-martingale.png)

Supply and Demand trading style and strategies are different. In some cases, traders or automatic trades need to anti-martingale(reverse-martingale) to catch market movement. Most of them seem to be when entering the zone without trigger. Then price goes in the opposite direction of zone and turn zone from supply to demand or vice versa. Anti-martingale calculates the next position size, and it will execute with new position size to enter next trade.
You can make a setting completely custom for your ideal or custom condition as after how many consecutive losses it start anti-martingale, continue anti-martingale until x step, and how much multiplication previous position size in every step of anti-martingale enter trade.
